### Project: RescueMe, Pet Adoption Website 🐾

In one of my projects,my team and I developed a pet adoption website that helps people find and give pets for adoption. The website serves as a platform where users can search for available pets based on their preferences, view pet profiles, and connect with pet owners for adoption.
